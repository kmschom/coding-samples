Collection of Coding Samples

C Projects:
  3-1.c is a school assignment for my CIS 314 Computer Organization class. The goal was to define an IntArray struct
  sgrep.c is a school assignment for my CIS 212 Computer Science III class. The goal was to write sgrep to search one or more input files (or standard
      input if no file is given) for lines containing the given string. It needs to support flags to ingnore case distinctions, invert and print the 
      non-matching lines, and print a count of matching lines.

Python Projects:
  rb_tree.py is a school assignment for my CIS 313 Intermediate Data Structures class. The goal was to implement a Red-Black Tree using a Binary Search
        Tree structure. I was given a working traverse, insert and delete method for a BST. I extended the functionality to support a balanced insert 
        and delete operations.
  test_lab.py is a file of test cases used to test the functions in the rb_tree.py file. 
  NFL_spread.py is a personal project of mine with the goal to win my family's football picks pool for the 2020-2021 NFL season. The program is not finished,
        so I'll blame my loss this year on that.
